# BOMB

# Game Rules
Start the game by searching for a movie. After a movie is successfully pulled dowm from The Movie Database API, you will see a poster of that movie and be prompted to name an actor who appeared in that movie. If you correctly name an actor from that movie, you will see a picture of that actor then be prompted to name a movie that actor appeared in. You cannot reuse the same movie within the same round. This continues until you fail to name a suitable actor or movie depending on the turn.
